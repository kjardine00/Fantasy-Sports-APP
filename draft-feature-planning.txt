DRAFT FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
=====================================

REQUIREMENTS GATHERED:
- Snake draft (primary) + Auction draft (future option)
- Timer: 60 seconds to 10 minutes configurable
- 4-12 league members (even numbers only)
- Variable roster sizes per league (commissioner customizable)
- Live player list updates
- Turn notifications with sound
- No chat feature needed initially

RECOMMENDED APPROACH: Next.js + Supabase Realtime (Serverless)
==============================================================

WHY THIS WORKS:
- Stays within current tech stack (Next.js + Supabase)
- No additional server management needed
- Handles 4-12 users easily
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
- Cost-effective and beginner-friendly

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW:
==================================

Database Schema Needed:
- drafts (id, league_id, type, status, current_pick, timer_end)
- draft_picks (id, draft_id, team_id, player_id, pick_number, timestamp)
- draft_timer (draft_id, time_remaining, is_active)

Real-time Flow:
1. Draft Start: Server Action creates draft, broadcasts to all league members
2. Turn Management: Supabase Realtime notifies whose turn it is
3. Player Selection: Server Action processes pick, updates database
4. Live Updates: All clients receive real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
5. Timer: Server-side timer with client-side countdown display

Key Features:
- Snake draft logic (1-12, 12-1, 1-12...)
- Auction draft support (future)
- Configurable timers (60s - 10min)
- Real-time player list updates
- Browser notifications + sound alerts
- Automatic pick handling when time expires

NEXT STEPS TO CONSIDER:
1. Design database schema for drafts
2. Set up Supabase Realtime subscriptions
3. Create draft interface components
4. Implement Server Actions for draft logic
5. Add notification system (browser + sound)

BENEFITS:
- No hosted backend needed
- Stays in current ecosystem
- Easier deployment and maintenance
- Great learning experience for real-time web development
- Handles all requirements efficiently

This approach will work perfectly for your fantasy sports draft feature!
